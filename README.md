# One Script A Day

The concept here is simple. 

Each day at 18:30, [@gladysproject](https://twitter.com/gladysproject) is going to tweet a simple script with hashtag [#OneGladysScriptADay](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23OneGladysScriptADay&src=typd) to show the infinite possibilities of Gladys !

Each script is listed in this GitHub repository for archive, or available on Twitter!
